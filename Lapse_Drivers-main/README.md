# Lapse_Drivers
The project uses advanced analytics techniques to investigate lapse drivers.

Each file serves the following purpose:
- Model_Development.ipynb: Trains the model and does all the required processing to investigate lapse drivers.
- Deployment_Retrain.ipynb: Can be used to retrain/change the deployed model and investigate latest lapse drivers (if required).
- synthetic_data.py: Assisted in creating synthetic data.
- Report_Processing_Example.py: Serves as an example on how to process the lapse driver investigation file.
